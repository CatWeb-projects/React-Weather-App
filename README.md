Atomic Design Pattern (ask your mentor first)
Todo:
Add the ability to click on a day, and see its hourly forecast.
Add React Router to the project (yarn add react-router) and add routes, such that /shows-5-day-forecast, and /[name-of-day]-forecast shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
Sign up for a free API key from Open Weather Map, fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.
